This is called emulsification of fats. The bile also makes the medium alkaline so that the pancreatic enzyme containing lipase further digest fats to form fatty acids. The alkaline medium is required for pancreatic enzyme to act on lipase.",

Water first splits to release oxygen and hydrogen. This process is photolysis of water. Hydrogen then combines with carbon dioxide to form glucose. The by-product of autotrophic nutrition is oxygen, which is released through stomata.",
